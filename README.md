# pokedex-nextjs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It wraps around the public [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to serve as a quick Pokedex for players and enthusiasts that want to learn more about their Pokemon.
